### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the HR data of a company and create a PowerBI dashboard to represent the same. By analyzing various aspects of the HR data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's human resource.

### Data Sources
HR Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "hr-data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each human resource of the company.

### Data cleaning/ Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
Data loading and inspection, handling missing values, data cleaning and formatting and creating tables and hr metrics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the HR data to answer key questions, such as:
1) How many people are in each job?
2) Gender break-down of the staff
3) Age spread of the staff
4) Which jobs pay more?
5) Top earners in each job
6) Qualification vs. Salary
7) Staff growth trend over time
8) Employee filter by starting letter
9) Leave balance analysis
10) Quick HR Dashboard

### Data Analysis
- Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot.
- Adding columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
- Finding relationships between salary and education qualification.
- Using visual filters to see top / bottom paid staff in each job.
- Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colours, axis, labels and legend).
