### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the first sheet "data" in the "Excel Analysis Project.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What does the sales in different countries look like?
- Which are the top 5 products by dollars per unit?
- Which are the top and least performing countries?
- What is the total profit made across different countries for each product?
- Make a dynamic country-level sales report
- Which products can be considered to be discontinued?

### Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- India brings in the highest revenue for the other company among the other countries and highest number of units is sold in USA.
- Raspberry choco, Peanut Butter Cubes, 85% Dark Bars, Baker's Choco Chips and After Nines are the top 5 products by dollars per unit.
- Gigi Bohling from Australia is the top performer and Barr Faughny from Australia is the least performer by revenue.
- Caramel Stuffed Bars is the most selling product across the countries.
- Considering the Revenue, Units sold and the profit %, we can conclude that Almond Choco can be considered to be discontinued across the globe.

### Recommendations
- Although Baker's Choco Chips makes the highest profit, it can be considered to be discontinued in USA and Canada as it does not meet the expectations in those countries.
- Demand for Eclairs is seen to be very low in Australia, hence Eclairs can be considered to be discontinued in Australia and instead can be promoted in countries like India and Canada where the demand is high for the said product.

### Limitations
The sales analysis couldn't be carried out for different seasons as we did not have a dedicated date column.
